# PLZA_ShinyCharm_BattleCalc
A tool to calculate how many battles you have left until Mable decides you are worthy of the Shiny Charm in Pokemon Legends Z-A.
# Why was this tool made?
I am currently working on obtaining the shiny charm in the 2025 Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends: Z-A. However, you need to win 1000 battles as one of the requirements to obtain it.
# How do I use this tool?
First, you need to start your method to do battles (Z-A Royale, Resturants, Jacinthe) and see how long it takes until you are done (Day arrives, finish the full course, or with Jacinthe, see how long it takes for a number of battles), then input the number of wins and how many min it took. After this is done 2 more times, you will input how many battles you have completed. The tool will then calcuate how many battles you have left, your battles per minute, battles per hour, and most importantly, how much more time it will take to get 1K battles.
