# PLZA_ShinyCharm_BattleCalc
A tool to calculate how many battles you have left until Mable decides you are worthy of the Shiny Charm in Pokemon Legends Z-A.

# Why was this tool made?
I am currently working on obtaining the shiny charm in the 2025 Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends: Z-A. However, you need to win 1000 battles as one of the requirements to obtain it. So, I decided to make a tool to see how much more grinding you have to do to get it.

# Running the tool
As of now, there is no .exe so you will need to have Python, along with the python module Tkinter (which should be installed by default) installed. Linux devices should have python and tkinter pre-installed, but on Windows, or a system without Python installed, you will need to go to https://python.org/downloads and get the most recent stable release (***not* a pre-release**). After Python is installed, in the command line, run `python path/to/main.py`. Note that on linux systems you may need `python3 path/to/main.py`, and sometimes on windows, you will need `py path/to/main.py`

# How do I use this tool?
First, you need to start your method to grind battles and see how long it takes until you are done (see below for tips on timing), then input the number of wins and how many min it took. After this is done 2 more times, you will input how many battles you have completed. The tool will then calcuate how many battles you have left, your battles per minute, battles per hour, and most importantly, how much more time it will take to get 1K battles won.

# Recomended Timings
Below are some recomended times to start and stop timing. However, some terms are spoilers for late/post game in Pokemon Legends Z-A.
You have been warned.


# Z-A Royale
Start timing as soon as the "Battle Zone Activated" cutscene ends, stop timing as soon as the "Battle Zone Deactivated" cutscene is shown. Also, feel free to include promotion/reward matches as part of the timer, but make sure to do it right after the sun comes up.

# Any Resturant
Start timing as the start of the first battle, at the "You are challenged by ..." screen, stop as soon as you are given rewards.

# SPOILER WARNING
This character that is talked about is in the late game of Pokemon Legends Z-A. Also, this next method is part of the postgame, so if you don't want to have major spoilers for a character or postgame content, stop here!





Final chance! Don't say I didn't warn you.



# Jacinthe*
*This may not be correct as I have not reached this part of the postgame.

Start timing at the first "You are challenged by Jacinthe of the SBC" screen. However, when to stop is where things get complicated. Jacinthe and her rematches are an endurance test, meaning that there is no predefined end, so you choose when to stop timing.
